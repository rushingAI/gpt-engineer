💎 GLASS STYLE GUIDE (Glassmorphism)
================================================================================

VISUAL LANGUAGE:
- **Form**: Translucent, layered, frosted glass aesthetic
- **Colors**: Subtle tints on transparent surfaces, light primary (#60a5fa, #3b82f6), white/light text
- **Typography**: Clean sans-serif (Inter, SF Pro) with medium weights
- **Shapes**: Large rounded corners (1rem+), semi-transparent layers
- **Interaction**: Subtle opacity shifts, blur intensity changes, smooth transitions

DESIGN TOKENS GUIDANCE:
- Background: Light gradient or soft image with blur overlay
- Primary: Light blue or teal (#60a5fa, #22d3ee) with low opacity
- Surface: backdrop-blur with rgba backgrounds (white/10-20%), thin borders
- Radius: 1rem - 1.5rem (smooth, large rounded)
- Shadow: Subtle, soft shadows with low opacity
- Animation: 300-500ms smooth, focus on opacity/blur transitions

COMPONENT PATTERNS:
- Buttons: Translucent with border, increase opacity on hover, subtle backdrop blur
- Cards: Semi-transparent white/10-15% with backdrop-blur-lg, thin white border (30% opacity)
- Inputs: Glass-like with subtle border, increase blur on focus
- Text: Crisp contrast on blur backgrounds, avoid overuse of transparency on text

LAYOUT & SPACING:
- Layered depth with overlapping glass panels
- Generous padding (p-8, p-10) to separate content from edges
- Floating layouts with space between elements
- Background: Soft gradients, abstract shapes, or images (always blurred)

ATMOSPHERE:
- Clean, modern, premium feel
- Translucency creates depth and sophistication
- Light, airy, minimalist with focus on content
- Subtle motion maintains elegance

DO NOT:
- Use fully opaque backgrounds on primary surfaces
- Over-complicate with too many layers
- Use heavy shadows or glows
- Skip backdrop-blur (it's essential to glass aesthetic)
